## Apify Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

Implementation of an MCP server for [Apify Actors](https://apify.com/store).
This server enables interaction with one or more Apify Actors that can be defined in the MCP server configuration.

The server can be used in two ways:
- **MCP Server Actor** - Actor runs an HTTP server that supports the MCP protocol via SSE (Server-Sent Events).
- **MCP Server CLI** - Command-line interface that supports the MCP protocol via stdio.

## üîÑ What is model context protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI applications (and AI agents), such as Claude Desktop, to connect to external tools and data sources.
MCP is an open protocol that enables secure, controlled interactions between AI applications, AI Agents, and local or remote resources.

## üéØ What does this MCP server do?

The MCP Server Actor allows an AI assistant to:
- Use any [Apify Actor](https://apify.com/store) as a tool to perform a specific task.For example it can:
  - [Facebook Posts Scraper](https://apify.com/apify/facebook-posts-scraper) extract data from hundreds of Facebook posts from one or multiple Facebook pages and profiles
  - [Google Maps Email Extractor](https://apify.com/lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details) Extract Google Maps contact details
  - [Google Search Results Scraper](https://apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper) Scrape Google Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs)
  - [Instagram Scraper](https://apify.com/apify/instagram-scraper) scrape and download Instagram posts, profiles, places, hashtags, photos, and comments
  - [RAG Web Browser](https://apify.com/apify/web-scraper) perform web search, scrape the top N URLs from the results, and return their cleaned content as Markdown

## üß± Components

### Tools

Any [Apify Actor](https://apify.com/store) can be used as a tool.
By default, the server is pre-configured with the tools specified above, but it can be overridden by providing a list of Actor names in the `actors` query parameter.

The tool name must always be the full Actor name, such as `lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details`

```text
'apify/facebook-posts-scraper'
'apify/google-search-scraper'
'apify/instagram-scraper'
'apify/rag-web-browser'
'lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details'
```
The arguments for MCP tool represent input parameters for the Actor.
Please see the examples below and refer to the specific Actor's documentation for a list of available arguments.

### Prompt & Resources

The server does not provide any resources and prompts.
We plan to add Apify's dataset and key-value store as resources in the future.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

The Apify MCP Server can be used in two ways: **as an Apify Actor** running at Apify platform
or as a **local server** running on your machine.

### MCP Server Actor

#### Standby web server

The Actor runs in [**Standby mode**](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/standby) with an HTTP web server that receives and processes requests.

1. **Start server with selected Actors**. To use the Apify MCP Server with a custom set of Actors (e.g. Google Maps Email Extractor, Facebook Posts Scraper),
    send an HTTP GET request with your [Apify API token](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations) to the following URL.
    Provide a comma-separated list of Actors in the `actors` query parameter:
    ```
    https://mcp-server.apify.actor?token=<APIFY_API_TOKEN>&actors=lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details,apify/facebook-posts-scraper
    ```

2. **Initiate Server-Sent-Events (SSE)** by sending a GET request to the following URL:
    ```
    https://mcp-server.apify.actor/sse?token=<APIFY_API_TOKEN>
    ```
    The server will respond with a `sessionId`, which you can use to send messages to the server:
    ```shell
    event: endpoint
    data: /message?sessionId=a1b
    ```

3. **Send a message to the server** by making a POST request with the `sessionId`:
    ```shell
    curl -X POST "https://mcp-server.apify.actor?token=<APIFY_API_TOKEN>&session_id=a1b" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 1,
      "method": "tools/call",
      "params": {
        "arguments": { "searchStringsArray": ["restaurants in San Francisco"], "maxCrawledPlacesPerSearch": 3 },
        "name": "lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details"
      }
    }'
    ```
    The MCP server will start the Actor `lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details` with the provided arguments as input parameters.
    For this POST request, the server will respond with:

    ```text
    Accepted
    ```

4. **Receive the response.** The server will invoke the specified Actor as a tool using the provided query parameters and stream the response back to the client via SSE.
    The response will be returned as JSON text.

    ```text
    event: message
    data: {"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"{\"searchString\":\"restaurants in San Francisco\",\"rank\":1,\"title\":\"Gary Danko\",\"description\":\"Renowned chef Gary Danko's fixed-price menus of American cuisine ... \",\"price\":\"$100+\"...}}]}}
    ```

You can also start MCP server with a different set of tools by providing a list of Actor names in the `actors` query parameter.
```
https://mcp-server.apify.actor?token=<APIFY_API_TOKEN>&actors=junglee/free-amazon-product-scraper,junglee/free-amazon-product-scraper
```
You can find list of all available Actors in the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store).

### MCP Server at local host

#### Prerequisites

- MacOS or Windows
- The latest version of Claude Desktop must be installed (or another MCP client)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or higher)
- [Apify API Token](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api#api-token) (`APIFY_API_TOKEN`)

#### Install

Follow the steps below to set up and run the server on your local machine:
First, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:apify/actor-mcp-server.git
```
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd actor-mcp-server
npm install
```

Before running the server, you need to build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop to recognize the MCP server.

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration and edit the following file:

    - On macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    - On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

    ```text
    "mcpServers": {
      "apify-mcp-server": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "/path/to/actor-mcp-server/dist/index.js"
        ]
        "env": {
           "APIFY-API-TOKEN": "your-apify-api-token"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use the following command to select one or more Apify Actors:
    ```text
    "mcpServers": {
      "apify-mcp-server": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "/path/to/actor-mcp-server/dist/index.js",
          "--actors",
          "lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details,apify/facebook-posts-scraper"
        ]
        "env": {
           "APIFY-API-TOKEN": "your-apify-api-token"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. Restart Claude Desktop

    - Fully quit Claude Desktop (ensure it‚Äôs not just minimized or closed).
    - Restart Claude Desktop.
    - Look for the üîå icon to confirm that the Exa server is connected.

3. Examples

   You can ask Claude to perform web searches, such as:
    ```text
    Find and analyze recent research papers about LLMs.
    Find best restaurants in San Francisco.
    Find and analyze comments about the latest iPhone.
    ```

## üë∑üèº Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or higher)
- Python 3.6 or higher

Create environment file `.env` with the following content:
```text
APIFY_API_TOKEN=your-apify-api-token
```

### Local client (stdio)

To test the server locally, you can use `examples/clientStdio.ts`:

```bash
node dist/clientStdio.js
```

The script will start the MCP server with two Actors (`lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details` and `apify/rag-web-browser`).
Then it will call `apify/rag-web-browser` tool with a query and will print the result.

### Chat local client (stdio)

To run simple chat client, you can use `example_chat_stdio.ts`:

```bash
node dist/example_chat_stdio.js
```
Here you can interact with the server using the chat interface.

### Local client (SSE)

To test the server with the SSE transport, you can use python script `examples/client_sse.py`:
Currently, the node.js client does not support to establish a connection to remote server witch custom headers.

```bash
node dist/clientSse.js
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers operate over standard input/output (stdio), debugging can be challenging.
For the best debugging experience, use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

Build the actor-mcp-server package:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node /path/to/actor-mcp-server/dist/index.js --env APIFY_API_TOKEN=your-apify-api-token
```

Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.
